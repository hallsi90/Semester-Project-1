        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>
          Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky
          Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about
          the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and
          galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators
          who used the stars to travel by.
          <br /><br />
          Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders,
          to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in
          our solar system.

        <h2 class="title">Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
          question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
          here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
          framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
          <br /><br />
          Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
          know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet
          a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
          Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
        <p>
          From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
          are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
          world.
          <br /><br />
          For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality
          of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
          medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine
          and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
          penicillin and the first heart transplant.
          <br /><br />
          Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the
          lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow
          creatures have beat us to it.

        <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
        <p>
          The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
          intelligence are the science of the future.
          <br /><br />
          From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics,
          the future is here.
          <br /><br />
          Have you ever wondered what it's like to talk to a robot, or how
          robots know what to do and when to do it? Join us on an exciting
          journey into the world of Robotics and AI, where we'll explore the
          amazing things that robots can do! You can even say hello and shake
          the hand of Rob the Robot. He can walk, talk, and even play games with
          you. Have you ever played tic-tac-toe with a robot? Now's your chance!
          Our robots love making new friends and can't wait to meet you.

        <h2 class="title">Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
          planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
          create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
          planet.
          <br /><br />
          In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
          currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and
          pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
          contribute to a brighter future.
